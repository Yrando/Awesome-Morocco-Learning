Welcome Interns:

in this repository you'll find a variety of subjects that may pick your interest.
consider this a glossary kind of thing where you can find helpful guides and resources that could prove helpful during your internship at 
" l'office de formation Professionnel et la promotion de travail".

I made this repository because i realized that the IT department for the most part sucks at preserving and managing important studying material and that they really like wasting time and resources migrating their stuff from one platform to the other and have of the time you find it empty.
